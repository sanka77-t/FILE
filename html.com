I had done twenty miles to cover a distance of eight hundred km, at first riding in a mortobyke
was not easy. Our designer sprts bike during the race on the road it was to firs for our
control as it slid on the bump almost falling with it.

We arrived quite on time and able to join the rest of the family and celebrate with them. It was a long
holiday where wee all met as a family and cousins.
